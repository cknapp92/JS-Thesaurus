What is hexadecimal? 

A base 16 numbering system. After we count from 0-9, we move onto letters a-f, which represent the numbers 10-15. We can create 256 values because number is 16 (16 times 16 = 256).

There's a place for red, green, and blue, which we combine to make any color. The first two digits are for red, next two for green, then two for blue. 

#000000 = black
#ffffff = white

When the red digits equals the blue and green digits, it is a variant of gray (i.e. #f5f5f5)

Hexadecimal short hand - when each digit is used as both digits for each color (i.e. #fff = white)



What is the difference between a class and an id?

A class is similar to an id. But you can have multiples of classes on a page. Ids are unique and cannot be repeated on a single page.

A class will provide greater flexibility.



What is the float property?

Allows an imaged to be "floated" to the left or right and text can flow around it. The float property will allow images to appear side-by-side rather than on top of one another

When items are floated, it is important to set the width property to determine how many elements should occup the width of  the page.


Note: margin has a tendency to push items where they shouldn't go (i.e. parent items)


How do you prevent other parts of the page from being manipulated by float?

You use the clear property, usually clear: both;

How to make links side-by-side in a nav bar?

}

How do you make it easier to click on links (to click a link using the area around the link text)?


To make it easier to click on a link, you can add padding to the anchor tags in CSS. For example:

}
