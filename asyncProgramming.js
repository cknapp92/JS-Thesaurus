What is the problem with loops?


When you start doing async programming, you can't repeat asynchronous programming with a loop. Loops become useless to us. We need to find ways of processing streams of data when they come in without using loops. 

We can replace loops with simple functions such as forEach, map, filter and other functions that don't change the original array but create a new, original array.
